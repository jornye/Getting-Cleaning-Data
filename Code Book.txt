Script Description
R script developed as part of Week 4 Peer Graded Assignment for Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project. The purpose of the script is to merge the test and train datasets included in the UCI HAR dataset specified in the course project instructions, and ultimately satisfy the marking criteria for the peer graded assignment. 

UCI HAR Dataset Files Used
-	'features.txt': List of all features.

-	'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.

-	'train/X_train.txt': Training set.

-	'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.

-	'test/X_test.txt': Test set.

-	'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

-	'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30.

-	'train/subject_test.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30.
